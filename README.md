This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
It aims to create a protfolio for myself on 2022. Depends on the effort I might test extra tech on the project.

## Getting Started
Firstly, install the dependecies with:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or 
pnpm install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Tech-stack selection

- Next.js - as foundamental framework (I might not optimizing SSR stuff tho)
- TailwindCSS + daisyUI - for styling
- Jotai - for state management (for a taste)
- Vercel - for deployment


## Deploy on Vercel
The project is deployed on vercel with a custom domain: [minjie-huang.com](https://minjie-huang.com)
